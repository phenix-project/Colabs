        "# Introduction to CCTBX\n",
        "\n",
        "The CCTBX project (computational crystallography toolbox) initially started as a library containing algorithms for the handling of unit cells, space groups, and atomic scatterers. Since then it has grown into a large project to support a variety of structural biology workflows, including x-ray and neutron crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and x-ray free electron lasers. \n",
        "\n",
        "The CCTBX library is written in Python, with many of the lower level algorithms accelerated using C++ via the Boost Python bindings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The principal high-level cctbx objects are:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Data Manager: Read and write files and keep track of them\n",
        "  - Model Manager: A molecular model or models and restraints that go with them\n",
        "  - Map Manager: A 3D map or maps and information about gridding and map symmetry\n",
        "  - Map Model Manager: One or more related maps and models as a group\n",
        "  - F-Model Manager: Combines a model and a related Miller array (map coefficeints, or other data for each index of a map)\n",
        "\n",
        "\\\n",
        "These high-level cctbx objects are composed of lower-level objects that implement various concepts in macromolecular crystallography, which are in turn composed of CCTBX flex arrays for efficient computation of numerical data. Finally, user defined parameters are managed and shared betwen objects using the CCTBX Phil module. \n",
        "\n",
        "\\\n",
        "The examples presented here aim to illustrate working with the core CCTBX data types using example data. Much of the content is adapted from the official CCTBX documentation: http://cci.lbl.gov/docs/cctbx/\n",
        "\n",
        "\\\n",
        "Many of the examples are drawn directly from those created by Dorothee Liebschner and Tom Terwilliger. Additional credit goes to Billy Poon for packaging CCTBX as a conda package, and to Billy and Claudia for helping to get CCTBX working in a Colab notebook."
