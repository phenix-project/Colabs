        "\n",
        "1. TYPICAL JOB: A normal job should just consist of hitting the Run cell button, saying ok to any questions from Colab and uploading the .tgz file from your Downloads folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. STARTING UP and the RUN CELL icon. Start your run by hitting the <b><i>Run cell</i></b> button at the upper left corner of the notebook (looks like a white triangle in a black circle). When it starts, the white triangle turns into a square and the circle has a rotating black arc circling around it.  If it stops, either the white triangle comes back (ok finish), or the icon turns red (a crash).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. UPLOADING. When the upload button appears, upload your .tgz file (usually in your Downloads directory) as specified by the Phenix GUI.  If your jobname (in th Phenix GUI) is my_job then this file will have a name like \"my_job_cycle_3.tgz\" if this is cycle 3 of building. The Phenix GUI log file will show the name of this file.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. STOPPING A RUN. You can stop the run by clicking on the \"Run cell\" button. It will turn red.  You can rerun it by clicking it again. This will allow you to upload the .tgz file again (or upload another one).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. CRASHES. If something goes wrong, the \"Run cell\" button will turn red and a message should appear in red. You can hit the \"Run cell\" icon to run again. \n",
        "\n",
        "6. GPU and HIGH RAM. At the upper right of the notebook to the left of the \"Editing\" icon there is a little down-arrow. This has a \"view resources\" option that allows you to change the \"runtime type\" if necessary. You want Hardware accelerator set to GPU and Runtime shape set to High-RAM if possible (may not be possible if you have standard Colab, so Standard is ok but may not be sufficient for larger chains). Background execution will usually be off (but if you have Colab Pro+ it may be on, allowing you to keep running while you are disconnected).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. RAM, DISK and RECONNECT. Also to the left of the \"Editing\" icon there will be either two progress bars labelled RAM and DISK or the word \"Reconnect\".  The RAM and DISK icons tell you how much of your allocated memory and disk space are used.  If \"Reconnect\" shows, it means that you are not connected to a \"Runtime\" (a computer that will run your notebook).  You can hit \"Reconnect\" and it should try to connect you.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. BUSY. If the Colab computers are crowded, you can get a \"Busy\" when you try to \"Reconnect\" or when you hit the \"Run cell\" button to try and run.  In this case you may have to wait and try again (try a few times, often it will start up by itself eventually once you hit \"Reconnect\", but you might have to wait a few hours too.)\n",
        "\n",
        "9. IS IT RUNNING. Look for the rotating black arc around the Run cell icon and the RAM and DISK icons (and make sure it does not say \"Busy\" at the upper right to the left of the Editing icon).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. DID IT INCLUDE TEMPLATES. Look in the text that is printed for something like: \"Including templates:\n",
        "\t MY_JOB_1_CYCLE_3_INPUT_A\".  Here the \"1\" is chain 1 and the \"3\" is cycle 3 and the jobname is my_job.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. AUTOMATIC DOWNLOAD. When the notebook finishes it should download a zip file with your results. If necessary, copy this file to the directory specified in the Phenix GUI. The name of this zip file if your jobname is \"my_job\" and this is cycle 3 of building chain 1 will be \"my_job_1_cycle_3.result.zip\".  Usually the automatic download puts the zip file in the right place and your Phenix GUI job continues on by itself without you having to do anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. CLOSE NOTEBOOK WHEN DONE. You can close this notebook when done.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. MULTIPLE CHAINS.  If your structure has multiple chains, then each one will be predicted separately and each one will get its own downloaded zip file.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. GENERALLY IGNORE WARNINGS.  You may get a warning like \"FutureWarning: jax.tree_util.tree_multimap() is deprecated\".  This can be ignored.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. UNABLE TO FIND FILE:  If you get the error: \"Unable to find a file_with_instructions in /content/upload_dir\" this means that the file you uploaded (your .tgz file) did not contain everything that was expected.  It usually means that this was the wrong file to upload (just hit Run cell again). It could also be that the Phenix GUI did not write out all the necessary files. (If you unpack the .tgz file it should contain a file with a name like run_jobname_predicted_1_cycle_3.dat).\n",
